    Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software 
    developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers
    faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by 
    numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

    Pattern: Factory
    
    Description:
        Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern 
        comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
        In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer 
        to newly created object using a common interface.
