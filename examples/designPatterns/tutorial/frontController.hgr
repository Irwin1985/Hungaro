    Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software 
    developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers
    faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by 
    numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

    Pattern: Front Controller
    Description:
        The front controller design pattern is used to provide a centralized request handling 
        mechanism so that all requests will be handled by a single handler. This handler can do 
        the authentication/ authorization/ logging or tracking of request and then pass the requests 
        to corresponding handlers. Following are the entities of this type of design pattern.
