- [] Objects (Instances)

### Syntax

#### Expressions

```hungarian
# Strings
"Hello World"

# Numbers
1

# Booleans
true

# Arrays
[1, 2, 3]

# Maps
{ "key": "value" }

# Variable declaration
declare lsName = "John" # ls = local string
declare gsName = "John" # gs = global string

# Variable assignment
lsName = "John" # only strings can be assigned to strings
lsName = null # all variables can be assigned to null
lsName = 10 # this will throw an error because 10 is not a string

# Constant declaration
declare INTEREST = 0.05 # INTEREST is a local constant
declare _CAPITAL = 1000 # _CAPITAL is a global constant

"""
 Local constants start with a capital letter
 Global constants start with an underscore
 Constants cannot be reassigned
"""
